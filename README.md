Corner Grocer Program Documentation

The Corner Grocer program was designed to address the problem of tracking the frequency of items sold at a grocery store :3 . By reading a list of items from an input file, counting their occurrences, and providing various options for users to query and visualize this data, the program helps manage inventory data more effectively. Users can find the frequency of specific items, print a list of all items and their frequencies, and display a histogram of item frequencies.

What I Did Particularly Well

I did particularly well in organizing the code into separate files, which enhanced modularity and readability. By creating a clear class definition in CornerGrocer.h and implementing the class methods in CornerGroger.cpp, I maintained a clean separation of concerns. This approach made it easier to debug and extend the program. (imagine having everything in one file :3 )

Enhancements to the Code

To enhance my code, I could have implement error handling more better. For example, I could add checks to ensure that the input file exists and is not empty before attempting to read from it. Additionally, I could optimize the program's performance by reading and processing the input file more efficiently, perhaps by using more advanced data structures or  techniques. These improvements would make the code more efficient and secure by preventing crashes and ensuring smooth operation. 

Challenges and Overcoming Them

The most challenging part of the code was reading and counting the frequencies of items from the file. Initially, I struggled with handling file input and updating the frequency count correctly. I also encountered issues with getting the program to recognize that all necessary files were in the same directory. The compiler kept indicating that the files were not found, even though they were correctly placed. I overcame this by including the CornerGrocer.cpp :3 file directly in main.cpp with #include "CornerGrocer.cpp". This approach ensured that all parts of the program were compiled together correctly.

Transferable Skills

From this project, I gained valuable skills in file handling, class design, and the use of data structures like maps in C++. These skills are highly transferable to other projects and coursework that require managing and processing data efficiently. Additionally, my ability to write clear and modular code will be beneficial in any programming task.

Maintaining, Reading, and Adapting the Code

I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following several best practices:

Modularity: By separating the class definition, implementation, and main function into different files, I made it easier to manage and extend each part independently.
Comments: Adding inline comments helped explain the purpose of each section of the code, making it easier for others (and myself) to understand the logic.
Consistent Naming Conventions: Using clear and consistent naming conventions for variables and functions improved readability.
Error Handling: Including basic error handling for file operations ensured that the program could handle common issues gracefully.
These practices ensure that the program is easy to read, understand, and modify, which is crucial for long-term maintenance and collaboration.
